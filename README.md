As the sign on the door would indicate, this is my repo where I will be storing my solutions to as many of the Advent of Code 2021 challenges as I can solve in under two hours.

> ## *What is "Advent of Code"?*

Thank you for asking! 

As stated on their [About](https://adventofcode.com/2021/about) page:

> "Advent of Code is an Advent calendar of small programming puzzles for a variety of skill sets and skill levels that can be solved in any programming language you like. People use them as a speed contest, interview prep, company training, university coursework, practice problems, or to challenge each other."
